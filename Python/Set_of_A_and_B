Use code with caution.

Explanation:

set_difference function:

Takes two sets as input.
Iterates through elements in set_a.
If an element is not found in set_b, it's added to the result set.
Returns the resulting set difference.
find_set_difference_large_datasets function:

Handles large datasets by reading them from files.
Creates empty sets set_a and set_b.
Iterates through lines in file_a and adds elements to set_a.
Iterates through lines in file_b and adds elements to set_b.
Calls the set_difference function to calculate the difference.
Key improvements for large datasets:

File-based processing: Avoids loading entire datasets into memory, saving space.
Line-by-line reading: Processes data efficiently, especially for large files.
Set operations: Uses efficient set operations for membership testing and addition.
This approach effectively handles large datasets by using efficient memory management and optimized algorithms.
