Explanation:

Open the File:
The with open(filename, 'r') as file: block opens the file in read mode, ensuring proper file handling.
Skip the Header:
next(file) skips the first line of the file, which is the header.
Process Each Line:
For each line in the file:
line.strip().split() splits the line into a list of columns.
If there are at least 3 columns, the first and third columns are extracted and converted to integer and float, respectively.
A new value is calculated based on the two extracted values (in this case, multiplication).
The calculated new value is printed along with the first column.
Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of lines in the file. Each line is processed in constant time.
Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the maximum length of a line. This is the space required to store the current line being processed.
Additional Considerations:

Error Handling: Consider adding error handling to handle cases where the file cannot be opened, or if the line format is incorrect.
Data Validation: You might want to validate the extracted values to ensure they are of the correct type and within a valid range.
Custom Calculations: The new_value calculation can be customized to suit specific requirements.
Output Formatting: The output format can be adjusted to match desired specifications, such as using specific delimiters or formatting the numbers in a particular way.
By following this approach and considering the additional points, you can effectively process the given file and calculate the desired values.
